## Jacques

To get started:

- Add [ActiveModel Serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers) to the Gemfile
- `bundle`
- `rails db:create`
- Generate away. Of note: Don't overwrite any test or factory files (it should prompt you as you go along)
  - If you goof this up, you can always `git checkout -- <filename>` to get back what was there before it was overwritten.
